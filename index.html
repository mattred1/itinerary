          <h2>DC &rarr; Barcelona</h2>
          <h3>Flying through timezones is weird</h3>
          <p>Our first flight from Dulles to Amsterdam was actually terrible. They didn't turn off the lights for a long time and it took them forever to serve food. Mary and I both couldn't find a comfortable sleeping position. We couldn't lean back far enough and I was too tall to lay on my tray table.</p>
          <p>Once we made it to Amsterdam, we had to rush across the airport and were some of the last people to board the Amsterdam to Barcelona flight.</p>
          <p class="mb-5">Mary booked our Amsterdam &rarr; Barcelona flight with extra leg room (it was an accident since that flight was only going to be like 2 hours and our other was much longer. We definitely tried taking advantage by sleeping on that flight. We were partially successful. But at least we were nearly there.</p>

        <h3>We made it!</h3>
        <p>Once we arrived, we bought sim cards to use data on our phones, exchanged our cash, and picked up our luggage. Too bad our luggage was still in Amsterdam! So said the information person anyway, so we had them send it to our hotel, which they did for free.</p>
        <p class="mb-5">We left the airport with just our carry ons, checked in to our hotel, <a href="https://www.citadines.com/en/spain/barcelona/citadines-ramblas-barcelona/location/index.html" target="_blank">Citadines Rambla Barcelona</a> at La Rambla, 122, Barcelona, took an hour nap, and went out to La Rambla to walk around for a while. We explored La Boqueria and got some snacks there, then came back to pick up our luggage and get ready for an early dinner (we had to leave around 6pm to eat before the game otherwise I'd be a grumpy bear).</p>
        <h3>Time for F&uacute;tbol</h3>
        <h4 style="color:red;">FC Barcelona vs. Real Madrid at 8:45pm</h4>
        <p>We met up with Michelle and Mike at 6pm to go eat before the f&uacute;tbol game. We planned to eat at a nice restaurant close to the f&uacute;tbol stadium, but couldn't find it, so we ended up at a sandwich place, which seemed to be a part of the stadium grounds. We ate and had some beer and wine there before going in.</p>
        <p>We went to the stadium and wouldn't ya know it, some people were sitting in our seats, but we weren't positive, so we ended up calling security to help us and they kicked people out of our seats for us. Jerks.</p>
        <p>The game was AWESOME. Messi scored a one goal with five minutes left, then there was another goal by someone who was definitely not Messi. We also got Barcelona flags for free! They handed them out as we walked in the stadium and after each goal we waved them around. The feeling of being something that's so much bigger than yourself was unreal!</p>
        <p>We went out after the game to go back to our neighborhood. Leaving the stadium was <i>packed</i> and riding the metro with all those people was not ideal. We went straight to a bar called Boadara Barcelona that's supposed to be the oldest bar in Spain that was really nice. The bartenders had a fancy way of pouring their specialty drink, which tasted like a delicious, alcoholic throat lozenge.</p>
        <p>Since we were still hungry, we went out to a different bar to get some tapas. Turned out it was a complete college bar &ndash; there were frat bros <i>everywhere</i>. We tried some appetizers, left to go back to the hotel, and went to sleep.</p>

        <h3>Exploring the City</h3>
        <p>We got up around 9am and had breakfast at the hotel.</p>
      	<p>We made our way to Casa Mila, a house that was created by Antoni Gaudi and commissioned by the Mila family. We got in line to buy tickets and waited for about 20 minutes. Eventually, Mary got on her phone and bought tickets for a half hour later. Turns out that we were in line to buy tickets, but they only let people in at set times, so we were waiting for that set time, which was the same time we bought tickets for. We grabbed a snack from a few blocks down, looked at a fancy candy store, and came back for their self guided tour. The roof and attic were <i>really</i> cool looking. I wonder what they kept in the attic before they moved all the museum stuff in there?</p>
      	<p>We left and took the metro to La Sagrada Familia because it was in a different are of town.  We ended up grabbing a sandwich and waters and taking pictures of the outside of the building before going in for our 2:15pm trip up onto one of the spires. After that, we went back down and took pictures of the rest of the inside area. It. Was. AMAZING. I actually walked in and couldn't help but murmur, &quot;Holy crap&quot; It was another time where you looked around and felt so small in comparison.</p>
      	<p>We left and went for a proper lunch &ndash; essentially an open faced sandwich with white bull meat that has a particular name in Spanish, of which I obviously can't remember, along with a cheese plate and meat plate.</p>

      	<p>We left and went back to our room because at that point we were all exhausted. We took another great nap. It was super tough getting back up after an hour long nap. My nap really lasted an extra 20 minutes.</p>
        <h3>Dinner with a view</h3>
      	<p>We got back up and out the door for dinner at Terraza Martinez. It was at the top of a giant hill. We took the metro to right next to the hill, then planned on walking. After seeing how tall it was, we changed our minds and looked for the funicular (small train that goes sideways up hills andmountains) because we kept seeing signs. Turns out it was closed for maintenance, so we took a taxi instead because nobody wanted to walk. That REALLY stressed me out because I didn&#39;t think they would take credit cards and I had NO idea how we would pay this guy. Turns out he took cards, just like everybody else in Europe. We made it to the restaurant and got settled. The meal was really good! It was lobster and some kind of meaty fish that was on top of some sauce with potatoes. After we finished the lobster, they took the dish back and tossed in some poached eggs that really kicked it up a notch. I loved the idea of them taking back our plate and adding something to it. The dessert was also really good. I got a chocolate cane thing with a little bit of ice cream. It was basically like a really thick chocolate. I lovedddd it!</p>
      	<p>We left and went home in the taxi. We had talked about going out after, but there was no way I was feeling up to it after eating so much, so we went home to sleep.</p>

        <h3>Tapas Tour 🍹🍻 🥩🥓</h3>
          <p>We met our tapas tour guide on La Rambla, right outside of La Boqueria. She took us inside La Boqueria to sample several different snacks. Our tour guide lived in Barcelona for most of her life, so she knew all the good spots to go to.</p>
          <p>Here are some pictures and videos of things we ate:</p>

          </div>

        </div><br>

        <p>We ended up going to four different restaurants after La Boqueria, and ended up trying a local version of some vermouth too!</p>
        <p>After the tour ended, we walked to the beach and stuck our feet in the water, then headed to a brewery, called Black Lab.</p>



          <div class="row">

            </div>
          </div><br>
          

        <p>We left the brewery and went back to our hotel. At that point, we were hitting a wall and we wanted to make sure we were ready for our suckling pig dinner later that night!</p>

        <h3>Suckling pig dinner</h3>
        <p>We went to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/elyantardelaribera/" target="_blank">El Yantar de La Ribera</a> for dinner. Michelle and I got steak, and Mike and Mary got the pig. While it was really good, the skin was pretty tough, and it may have been overhyped a little. We also all agreed that last night's seafood meal was better.</p>

        <h3>Dr. Stravinsky: the science bar</h3>
        <p>After dinner, we went to a science bar called Dr. Stravinsky. The bar was decorated with lots of fun beakers and chemistry stuff. The drinks were good, too.</p>

        <h3>Parc Guell</h3>

        <p>We got up early to go to Parc Guell today. We had breakfast at the hotel so we could leave around 9:30am.</p>
        <p>The trip after the metro ride there was SUPER uphill. Turns out we could have taken a longer path with an incline that was not as steep, as opposed to what we did, which was a short walk but steep incline. By the time we got to park Guell, it was around 10:30 and the tickets had sold out. Too bad we didn't know there were tickets! We ended up walking around the area a little bit, but ultimately left early. We planned to come back Saturday when Michelle and Mike come back from San Sebastian.</p>

        <h3>Las Bambas</h3>
        <p>We took the metro back to the harbor where we walked around looking for Las Bambas. We spent some time at a brunch place brunch and cake and got drinks to pass the time until <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187497-d799065-Reviews-La_Bombeta-Barcelona_Catalonia.html" target="_blank">La Bambeta</a> opened up and we got some REAL authentic food there. The people didn't even speak English! We ate bombas and some escargot.</p>

        <h3>Sky Trolley</h3>
        <p>We left and went to the lift where we got hoisted up in the air and took a trolley thing through the sky to mount monjiuc where we had the fancy seafood dinner. Too bad it literally took us 1.5 hours to make it through the lift line and get across. We really took it just for the experience, and it was overall just okay because it took forever. We ended up walking down the side of the mountain/hill and went home for a snooze. We had done a lot of moving and had been out in the sun for a while</p>

        <h3>Tickets</h3>
        <p>We left for <a href="https://elbarri.com/en/restaurant/tickets/" target="_blank">Tickets</a> in a taxi, even though it was pretty close to where we were staying. It was pouring rain, and nobody wanted to mess up their hair 🤷‍♂️.</p>
        <p>Tickets is supposed to be one of the best restaurants in the WORLD. We had countless tapas that were mostly amazing. After like 10 different tapas, a guy walked over to us and invited us into <i>The Dessert Room.</i> The ceiling was covered with fake, giant, fruit. They had TVs on the walls that were all playing old movies. It was crazy. I will also say that I never want to pay that much for food. Like, ever again.</p>

        <p>We metro'ed home since it stopped raining and passed out once we got back to the hotel. I've never been more exhausted from eating.</p>

        <h3>Mich and Mike left for San Sebastian</h3>
        <p>Mary and I were on our own, starting today. We had a late breakfast and ate at a local café that was in a row home. The cafe had a really local vibe, mostly because the server didn't even know English. I had something that resembled a bacon, egg, and cheese, while Mary had a ham crepe. It was definitley delicious.</p>
        <h3>The Picasso Museum</h3>
        <p>We spent a good portion of the day walking around, exploring the area. We stopped to go check out <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187497-d190165-Reviews-Museu_Picasso-Barcelona_Catalonia.html" target="_blank">the Picasso museum</a>, which was enjoyable, but I was really annoyed that they were missing all of his works from 1933-1957. I'm assuming another museum has them, but it really leaves you feeling tricked. Here I am going to THE Picasso Musem, and they can't even give me a fully enriching Picasso experience.</p>
        <p>Mary started to feel sick at some point, so we had our first drugstore experience in Barcleona! They have some form of a medical professional at all the drug stores who are there to help you or fulfill prescriptions. This guy was a lot more willing to help than doctors we've experienced in the US.</p>
        <p>We stopped mid afternoon for some food, and we ended up going to this restaurant called <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187497-d3684577-Reviews-Llamber-Barcelona_Catalonia.html" target="_blank">Llamber</a>. They had surprisingly delicous food for a place that we just randomly discovered. One of our favorites was fingerling potatoes with creamy blue cheese and hazelnut cream topped with chives. <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187497-d3684577-Reviews-Llamber-Barcelona_Catalonia.html#photos;aggregationId=&albumid=101&filter=7&ff=385611072" target="_blank">Here's a picture that someone took of it.</a></p>
        <p>We walked around and shopped for a bit, then went home for another nap.</p>

        <h3>That evening</h3>
        <p>For dinner that night, we went to <a href="http://www.sensi.es/gourmet/" target="_blank">Sensi Gourmet Tapas</a>, which was a place Amanda recommended to us. There are three or four similarly named restaurants, all owned by the same person, so I got the feeling that we would have had fun at any of the retaurants we went to there. We had a bunch of delicious tapas and some mojitos. Because I am me, I decided that I wanted gelato when we were walking home. This is another city that has a bunch of random gelato restaurants. I half and half: stratiacella and kinder bueno bar. It was DELICIOUS.</p>

        <p>I'm super into fútbol for the time being, so I wanted to watch the FCB game against Manchester but didn't make it home in time. I can't wait to keep up with fútbol once we get home (<span style="color:#FF0000;">spoiler alert</span>: i'm doing a really bad job at it)!</p>

        <h3>Happy Birthday Mary!</h3>
        <p>What a day for a great birthday. Mary is spewing snot as I type this 😷.</p>

        <h3>Montserrat</h3>
        <p>Today on our agenta is <a href="https://www.barcelona-tourist-guide.com/en/tour/montserrat-spain.html" target="_blank">Montserrat</a>.</p>
        <p>We got up around 9am and managed to rush to placa catalunya where we met our tour group. We really cut it close in terms of actually getting there on time, because once we got there, we realized we hadn't eaten anything and we were about to be on a bus for about an hour. We didn't quite manage to adhere to the "no food on the bus" policy *<i>cue an image of us trying to sneakily shove a ham and cheese croissant the size of my hand in our mouths</i>*, but on the bright side, we were full by the time we arrived at the foot of the mountain!</p>
        <p>Instead of driving up the mountain, we took the cremallera, which is Spanish for "zipper." It was essentially a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funicular" target="_blank">funicular</a>, aka a train that goes up the side of a mountain. My stomach has gotten really weak in my old age, because I  got nauseous even after taking some dramamine.</p>
        <p>We made it to the top and took a guided tour of the area, then took a 20 minute hike up to Creu De Sant Miquel (The observation deck with the cross, pictured below).</p>

        <div class="row">

          <div class="col-sm-6">
            <img class="img-fluid" src="img/usonmontserrat.jpg" alt="Mary and Matt at on the observation deck" /><br>

          </div>
        </div><br>


        <p>The view was breathtaking. You could see for so many miles.</p>
        <p>We went back and picked up some samples of wine and cheese that the monks of the monastery had made. I bought some sweet nuts too, that had been made by the local farmers in the region that participate in the farmers' market. Apparently I love sweet nuts now. They were very handy to help settle my stomach during all the bus rides around.</p>
        <p>We left Montserrat to go have tapas and wine at one of the local castles of the region, named <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1063735-d3264887-Reviews-Oller_del_Mas-Manresa_Bages_Catalonia.html" target="_blank">Oller Del Mas</a>. We made friends with some of the other people on the tour, mostly older, retired, couples.</p>
        <p><span style="color:#FF0000;">Fun fact:</span> One of the bottles of wine we had at Tickets was from this winery, so that means that this winery has high quality wine.</p>
        <p>We took a nap on the way back to Barcelona, as well as when we actually got back to the hotel. Hiking and drinking wine really takes it out of you.</p>
        <p>Our dinner restaurant wasn't our best pick, unfortunately. It was called <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187497-d887376-Reviews-La_Vinateria_del_Call-Barcelona_Catalonia.html" target="_blank">La Vinateria del Call</a>. The food was good, but we made the mistake of showing up really early (8pm is early to these crazy people), so the five tapas we ordered that we expected to come out one at a time ended up coming out all at the same time. It actually took about five minutes to get all our tapas. We left after crushing some dessert and some cava and headed home for the day so Mary could get some extra sleep to recover from her cold.</p>
