          <h2>DC &rarr; Barcelona</h2>
          <h3>Flying through timezones is weird</h3>
          <p>Our first flight from Dulles to Amsterdam was actually terrible. They didn't turn off the lights for a long time and it took them forever to serve food. Mary and I both couldn't find a comfortable sleeping position. We couldn't lean back far enough and I was too tall to lay on my tray table.</p>
          <p>Once we made it to Amsterdam, we had to rush across the airport and were some of the last people to board the Amsterdam to Barcelona flight.</p>
          <p class="mb-5">Mary booked our Amsterdam &rarr; Barcelona flight with extra leg room (it was an accident since that flight was only going to be like 2 hours and our other was much longer. We definitely tried taking advantage by sleeping on that flight. We were partially successful. But at least we were nearly there.</p>

        <h3>We made it!</h3>
        <p>Once we arrived, we bought sim cards to use data on our phones, exchanged our cash, and picked up our luggage. Too bad our luggage was still in Amsterdam! So said the information person anyway, so we had them send it to our hotel, which they did for free.</p>
        <p class="mb-5">We left the airport with just our carry ons, checked in to our hotel, <a href="https://www.citadines.com/en/spain/barcelona/citadines-ramblas-barcelona/location/index.html" target="_blank">Citadines Rambla Barcelona</a> at La Rambla, 122, Barcelona, took an hour nap, and went out to La Rambla to walk around for a while. We explored La Boquaria and got some snacks there, then came back to pick up our luggage and get ready for an early dinner (we had to leave around 6pm to eat before the game otherwise I'd be a grumpy bear).</p>
        <h3>Time for F&uacute;tbol</h3>
        <h4 style="color:red;">FC Barcelona vs. Real Madrid at 8:45pm</h4>
        <p>We met up with Michelle and Mike at 6pm to go eat before the f&uacute;tbol game. We planned to eat at a nice restaurant close to the f&uacute;tbol stadium, but couldn't find it, so we ended up at a sandwich place, which seemed to be a part of the stadium grounds. We ate and had some beer and wine there before going in.</p>
        <p>We went to the stadium and wouldn't ya know it, some people were sitting in our seats, but we weren't positive, so we ended up calling security to help us and they kicked people out of our seats for us. Jerks.</p>
        <p>The game was AWESOME. Messi scored a one goal with five minutes left, then there was another goal by someone who was definitely not Messi. We also got Barcelona flags for free! They handed them out as we walked in the stadium and after each goal we waved them around. The feeling of being something that's so much bigger than yourself was unreal!</p>
        <p>We went out after the game to go back to our neighborhood. Leaving the stadium was <i>packed</i> and riding the metro with all those people was not ideal. We went straight to a bar called Boadara Barcelona that's supposed to be the oldest bar in Spain that was really nice. The bartenders had a fancy way of pouring their specialty drink, which tasted like a delicious, alcoholic throat lozenge.</p>
        <p>Since we were still hungry, we went out to a different bar to get some tapas. Turned out it was a complete college bar &ndash; there were frat bros <i>everywhere</i>. We tried some appetizers, left to go back to the hotel, and went to sleep.</p>

        <h3>Exploring the City</h3>
        <p>We got up around 9am and had breakfast at the hotel.</p>
      	<p>We made our way to Casa Mila, a house that was created by Antoni Gaudi and commissioned by the Mila family. We got in line to buy tickets and waited for about 20 minutes. Eventually, Mary got on her phone and bought tickets for a half hour later. Turns out that we were in line to buy tickets, but they only let people in at set times, so we were waiting for that set time, which was the same time we bought tickets for. We grabbed a snack from a few blocks down, looked at a fancy candy store, and came back for their self guided tour. The roof and attic were <i>really</i> cool looking. I wonder what they kept in the attic before they moved all the museum stuff in there?</p>
      	<p>We left and took the metro to La Sagrada Familia because it was in a different are of town.  We ended up grabbing a sandwich and waters and taking pictures of the outside of the building before going in for our 2:15pm trip up onto one of the spires. After that, we went back down and took pictures of the rest of the inside area. It. Was. AMAZING. I actually walked in and couldn't help but murmur, &quot;Holy crap&quot; It was another time where you looked around and felt so small in comparison.</p>
      	<p>We left and went for a proper lunch &ndash; essentially an open faced sandwich with white bull meat that has a particular name in Spanish, of which I obviously can't remember, along with a cheese plate and meat plate.</p>

      	<p>We left and went back to our room because at that point we were all exhausted. We took another great nap. It was super tough getting back up after an hour long nap. My nap really lasted an extra 20 minutes.</p>
        <h3>Dinner with a view</h3>
      	<p>We got back up and out the door for dinner at Terraza Martinez. It was at the top of a giant hill. We took the metro to right next to the hill, then planned on walking. After seeing how tall it was, we changed our minds and looked for the funicular (small train that goes sideways up hills andmountains) because we kept seeing signs. Turns out it was closed for maintenance, so we took a taxi instead because nobody wanted to walk. That REALLY stressed me out because I didn&#39;t think they would take credit cards and I had NO idea how we would pay this guy. Turns out he took cards, just like everybody else in Europe. We made it to the restaurant and got settled. The meal was really good! It was lobster and some kind of meaty fish that was on top of some sauce with potatoes. After we finished the lobster, they took the dish back and tossed in some poached eggs that really kicked it up a notch. I loved the idea of them taking back our plate and adding something to it. The dessert was also really good. I got a chocolate cane thing with a little bit of ice cream. It was basically like a really thick chocolate. I lovedddd it!</p>
      	<p>We left and went home in the taxi. We had talked about going out after, but there was no way I was feeling up to it after eating so much, so we went home to sleep.</p>
